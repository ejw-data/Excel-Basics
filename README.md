## Task 1 (Tab ‘Data’):  Formatting Data Table  

*  The state column (Column F) is color coded as the following:
   *  Green Text and Light Green Background Color are ‘successful’ cases
   *  Orange Text and Yellow Background Color are ‘canceled’ cases
   *  Red Text and Light Red Background Color are ‘failed’ cases  

*  I also modified the last two columns to include info to better define the heading.  ‘Date created’ and ‘Date ended’ don’t really match the type of data in the column – its campaign launched and campaign deadline.

## Task 2 (Tab ‘Analysis 1’)

## Task 3 (Tab ‘Analysis 2’)
I made the color coding match Task Two so it was easier to read.

## Task 4 (Tab ‘Analysis 3’)  

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?  
*  Most of the data is from the US (~75%) and the key categories driving Kickstarter campaigns varies from country-to-country.  It is pretty common for theater to be one of the key campaigns.  The first table indicates that the arts theater and music have had significant success (by volume and success rates) when using kickstarter.  
*  Of the subcategories, plays are the most common type of campaign particularly in GB, AU, and the US.  Other areas like publishing have not done very well with only certain subcategories having any success (nonfiction and radio/podcasts for US data).  This could mean that funding could be highly specific for the type of subcategory but since I am only looking at the total counts and not including the amount being asked this could be very misleading as to why difference categories failed.   
*  The business began greater volume after April 2014 so something different occurred during this time period so analysis of the data should be compared before and after the event to see if it is comparing apples to oranges.  It seems as if there was more consistent success stories over failed campaigns before April 2014.  

What are some limitations of this dataset?  
*  Knowing when the majority of the donations came in would be very helpful – meaning is success based on the initial donations in the first few days or consistent donations over the length of the campaign.  Also, knowing how they advertised their kickstarter is very important to knowing why people donated.  *  It would also be helpful to analyze who were the donors – were they local, random, one or two major donors or many small donations.  I would not use this data for countries that had small datasets – I think the US, AUS, and GB had fairly large numbers with the US out numbering all other campaign locations.   

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  

*  I would create more graphs that span over time – meaning I would compare success/failures by category/subcategory with all years shown on one bar graph because it seems as if the campaign type popularity probably changed over the course of the ~9 years and potentially the behavior of success and failures were influenced by the total donors versus the total campaigns (dilution) when viewed across multiple years.   
*  I would also look at success versus failed and canceled combined or similarly compare success versus total.  I would also create a table showing country involvement – there are significant differences when looking at country to country data.  I would only use this dataset to analyze US trends because the other country’s datasets are much smaller.

## Stats (Tab ‘Bonus’):  
The Total projects column could be calculated from the raw table data or summing the three columns to the left in the new table.  Normally, I would calculate it from the raw data to determine if everything adds up correctly.  I summed the columns to the left to match the instructions but there is a small difference
